"""Validate that diffs between two `.bin` golden vectors are alignment-only.

Used post-encoder-change (e.g. F01 alignment fix, F29 DHEADER framing, future
`decode_cdr2_le_at` migration) to confirm a relock of `golden_vectors.rs`
is safe — i.e., every byte position where the old and new payloads differ
either falls at a CDR2-spec alignment boundary (1/2/4-byte, cap-4 for 8-byte
primitives per DDS-XTypes v1.3 §7.4.3.4.1 Tab.15) and the new byte is the
zero-padding value required by §7.4.3.4.2.

Exit codes:
  0 — every diff position is alignment-induced; relock is safe.
  1 — at least one diff position is NOT explained by alignment; manual
      investigation required (potential bug in the new encoder).
  2 — usage / I/O error.

LIMITATION: the diff is positional (compares old[i] vs new[i] index-by-index).
It correctly classifies TAIL-only zero-padding growth (the F01 case for
fixed-layout struct primitives), but it does NOT handle MIDDLE-insertion
alignment growth where bytes shift inside the payload. Example: F29 DHEADER
framing prepends a 4-byte u32 length at the front of a TypeObject container
— every subsequent byte shifts by 4, and the script will report each
shifted byte as `VALUE_DIFFERS` / `TRAILING_CONTENT` even though the relock
is alignment-only.

For shift-inducing relocks (F29, future DHEADER additions, decode_cdr2_le_at
migrations that may insert leading padding), do NOT rely on this script's
exit code. Either (a) use a sequence-diff tool that handles insertions
(diff/LCS) before falling back to this script, or (b) inspect the hex dump
manually. The script remains useful for: (1) confirming byte-identity in
the no-drift case, (2) auditing tail-only zero-pad growth, (3) catching
suspicious VALUE_DIFFERS at the head of a payload that should not have
shifted.

Example:
    # During a F29 fix, regenerate goldens, then diff each pair:
    GOLDEN_REGEN=1 cargo test --test golden_vectors
    for old in /tmp/old_goldens/*.bin; do
        new=crates/hdds/tests/golden/cdr2/$(basename "$old")
        python3 tools/diff-golden-bytes.py "$old" "$new" || break
    done

The script does NOT replace human review — it surfaces the unexplained
diffs so a human can decide if the change is intentional (spec catch-up)
or a regression. See ADR-CHANTIER-1.6-AUDIT-RESPONSE §10.14
("methodologie cross-vendor") for context.
